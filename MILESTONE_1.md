# Milestone 1: Core Functionality Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-13

## Completed Features

### Core Algorithm ✅
- Circle generation starting from viewport corners
- Circle-border intersection calculations
- Circle-circle intersection calculations
- Step-by-step generation with 3-second delays
- Coverage validation (prevents overlapping circles)
- Deduplication (prevents duplicate positions)
- Automatic termination when no more intersections possible

### Visual Design ✅
- SVG-based rendering
- Sky blue stroke with white fill
- 20px radius circles
- Smooth opacity fade-in animations
- Newer circles render beneath older circles
- Full-screen canvas with white background
- No UI controls (minimalist design)

### Technical Implementation ✅
- Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- Proper floating-point precision handling
- Tolerance thresholds for numeric comparisons
- Coordinate rounding for consistency
- Console logging for debugging
- Responsive to window dimensions

### Testing ✅
- Comprehensive test suite (test-intersections.ts)
- Circle-border intersection tests
- Circle-circle intersection tests
- Coverage validation tests
- Full step simulation tests

### Documentation ✅
- CLAUDE.md (technical guidance)
- DESIGN_VISION.md (design specifications)
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (project goals)
- TESTING.md (testing notes and bug fixes)
- README.md (project summary)

## Key Bug Fixes

1. **Incorrect radius** - Fixed using 2R instead of R
2. **Circle-border exclusion** - Fixed `dx > 0` to `dx >= 0`
3. **Circle-circle formula** - Fixed intersection calculation
4. **Wild growth** - Added coverage validation
5. **Layer order** - Reversed rendering for proper z-index

## Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~260 (Canvas.tsx), ~250 (tests)
- **Test Coverage**: Core algorithms fully tested
- **Performance**: Handles generation until natural completion
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with SVG support
